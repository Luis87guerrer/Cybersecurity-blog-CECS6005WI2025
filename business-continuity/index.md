# Business Continuity Plan (BCP): keeping the mission alive during disruption

A **Business Continuity Plan (BCP)** answers one hard question:

> **How do we keep critical operations running when something serious goes wrong?**

Disruptions aren’t rare anymore. Cyberattacks, storms, power outages, vendor failures, and even internal errors can interrupt business. A BCP is how an organization avoids being “one incident away” from shutdown.

## What a BCP focuses on (and what it doesn’t)
A BCP is not just “IT backup.” It includes:
- people (staffing, roles, communications)
- processes (manual workarounds, alternate workflows)
- facilities (alternate locations)
- vendors (third-party outages and dependencies)
- technology (systems needed to support operations)

A BCP is about **continuing the business**, not only restoring servers.

## Why business continuity planning matters
Downtime has a cost:
- revenue loss
- operational backlog
- customer trust damage
- legal/regulatory risk
- reputational harm

A strong BCP reduces downtime and confusion by making continuity decisions in advance.

## The foundation: Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
A BIA identifies:
- the most critical functions
- how long each can be down before damage becomes unacceptable
- what resources they depend on (systems, people, vendors)

The BIA is where priorities come from. Without it, continuity becomes guesswork.

## Continuity strategies (what “staying alive” looks like)
A BCP usually includes strategies like:

### Alternate workflows
If a system goes down, what is the manual workaround?
Example: paper-based intake forms when a scheduling app fails.

### Redundancy
Duplicate what matters:
- redundant internet links
- alternate communication channels
- mirrored critical services

### Alternate sites / remote work
If a facility is unavailable, how do operations move?
Remote work plans require secure access, policies, and tested communication.

### Vendor and supply chain resilience
If your payroll vendor, cloud provider, or messaging platform fails, what’s the fallback?

## Testing: the part that separates a “plan” from a “fantasy”
A BCP is only real if it’s tested. Testing reveals:
- missing contact info
- assumptions that aren’t true
- dependencies nobody remembered
- steps that take longer than expected

Even a tabletop exercise can expose major gaps.

## BCP vs DRP (quick distinction)
- **BCP:** keep critical functions operating (broad: people, process, facilities, vendors, technology).
- **DRP (Disaster Recovery Plan):** restore IT systems and data (more technical, more IT-focused).

They should work together. A BCP can say *what must stay running*, and a DRP says *how IT gets restored*.

## Real-world example (easy to imagine)
A hurricane knocks out power and internet for parts of the island.
A business with a BCP can:
- switch to alternate communication
- move critical staff to a powered site
- run a reduced “critical services only” mode
- coordinate vendor support and customer updates

A business without a BCP loses days just figuring out what to do.
